    "- Environment : is where the agent lives and provides something for the agent to act.\n",
    "- policy : defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. That is, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.\n",
    "- reward : is a single number that the environment sends to the agent at each time step. It measures the effectness of taking a particular action.\n",
    "- reward signal : defines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. That is, it defines the good and bad events for the agent.\n",
    "- value of a state : is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. "
